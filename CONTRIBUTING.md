Summarized term definitions on [README.me](README.md) should not exceed 12-15 words or so. For longer definitions or explanations, link to an .md file in `glossary`. If a definition is simple, you do not need to add a `glossary` file.

Acronym forms of terms are best anchor-linked to fully-spelled-out forms, e.g.:

```
* **ADC**: See [analog-to-digital converter](#analog-to-digital-conversion)
* <a id="analog-to-digital-conversion"></a>**Analog-to-Digital Conversion**: The conversion of analog voltages to digital values
* **Analog-to-digital converter**: A device that can perform [Analog-to-digital conversion](#analog-to-digital-conversion)
```
